# Lane Detection Project

## Overview
This project is divided into two main parts: Basic Lane Detection and Advanced Lane Detection. It demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques to detect lanes on roads from video and image data. The Basic Lane Detection part focuses on simple techniques, while the Advanced Lane Detection part utilizes more complex algorithms and calibration methods.

## Project Structure
- **Basic Lane Detection:**
  - `lane_detection.py`: Core script for detecting lanes using basic methods.
  - `Line.py`: Contains the `Line` class used to model road lanes.
  - `main.py`: Main executable script for running the basic lane detection.

- **Advanced Lane Detection:**
  - `binarization_utils.py`: Utilities for image binarization.
  - `calibration_utils.py`: Camera calibration utilities.
  - `globals.py`: Global variables and configurations.
  - `line_utils.py`: Utilities to help with line detection and handling.
  - `main.py`: Main executable script for running the advanced lane detection.
  - `perspective_utils.py`: Utilities for perspective transformations.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- matplotlib (optional for visualization)
